Navigate to **Master Slider** in the side menu and click on the slider you're wanting to edit

In the top section, you can view the slides currently being used, and from here you can add, remove and reorder slides

## Removing slides

To remove a slide, click the **delete** button (the trashcan) for that slide in the top section

## Adding slides

To add a slide, use the **copy** button (circled) for one of the existing slides, this will ensure that all settings are copied across and you can easily replace the image with a new one.

Once you've duplicated an existing slide, follow the instructions below to change a slider image.

## Re-ordering slides

You can click and drag the slides to re-order them.

## Changing Slide Image

![](/src/img/cms/inkedchange_image_li.jpg)

To change a slider image, in the **Background**, click the **delete** icon for the **Background** image, then click the **+** icon that appears.

Choose an existing image from the **Media Library** or upload a new image. At the biggest point, the slider images will be `1200px` wide and `500px` tall so make sure the image is big enough to fit this size.



Make sure you remember to click **Save Changes** at the bottom when you're done.
