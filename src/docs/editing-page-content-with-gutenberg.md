If you have an updated/new website, you'll be using the new Gutenberg editor on your WordPress site. The Gutenberg editor allows creating custom content blocks and gives a good visual editing experience as well as a good developer experience. When editing a page, you can add new content blocks by typing or clicking the **+** icon to add a new block.

## Main Content Area

This is where most of the page content comes from. Here you can change the page name and any content that appears on the page (including images).

You can add headings and block quotes here (a block quote will be a break out quote with extra styling on your website) as well as write all your content for the page.
