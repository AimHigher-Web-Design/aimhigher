The different Careers are a custom post type, and are accessible from the **Careers** option in the side admin menu. From here they can be edited the same as pages (clicking to edit), or you can choose **Careers** -> **Add New** in the side menu, or the **Add New** button at the top of the *Careers* page to create a new career.
Each career requires several bits of information to be set so that they are accessible on the website and so that it build properly.
