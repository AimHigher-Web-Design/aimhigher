Our founder Amy Kapernick grew up in rural Queensland where most people she knew had small businesses. While those businesses started to look into getting themselves online the barriers to entry stop them in their tracks. Something had to changeâ€¦

Amy [wears many hats](https://amyskapers.dev) as a web developer, business owner and conference speaker. She regularly shares her knowledge with her peers and the next generation of developers. Through mentoring, coaching, teaching Amy loves feeding into the tech community any way she can.
